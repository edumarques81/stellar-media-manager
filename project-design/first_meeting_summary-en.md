### <â Company Overview
- Photography company divided into three main areas:
  - Youth sports: action photography of local sports, especially children in clubs
  - School portraits: graduation photos, proms, school events
  - Various event coverage: rugby tournaments, Lusatra, among others
- Sales model:
  - Photos taken are sold to parents through online store
  - Photos organized by teams, with individual identification of children

### =» Current Systems and Workflow
- Two main software systems:
  - Portrait system (Netlife):
    - Receives data from clubs/schools (name, age, team, parents, address, phone, email)
    - Data organized in spreadsheets and imported into the system
    - Allows photographing and associating images directly to each child/team
    - Photos edited, organized in folders by name and team, then republished in online store
    - AI facial recognition
  - Sports event system (Skill Chair):
    - Receives participant data (name, team, age, email, phone, address)
    - Uses jersey/number recognition and facial recognition to organize photos
    - Participants can search their photos by jersey number or facial recognition
    - Similar process to selling photos by identification at sports events

### =à Netlife Structures and Features
- Booking module:
  - Clubs request photographers through the system
  - Portal for clubs to submit player data
  - Teams and members organized by season/year, with ability to add/remove players, mark absences, take sibling photos, create new teams
- Photo organization:
  - Photos grouped by club, teams (by age), individuals and total teams
  - Photos transferred from computer to Australian server after editing
  - Semi-annual backup on external HD, followed by local deletion

### ™ Current Problems and Future Objectives
- Problems with current software vendor (Netlife):
  - Customization difficulties (e.g.: adding marketing consent button)
  - Restrictions on adapting specific business features
- Objective to migrate to new software (Timestone):
  - Integrate all features into a single system, including online store management
  - Avoid QR/barcode-based systems, as they are considered confusing and error-prone
  - Develop exclusive customizations for own use, maintaining competitive advantage
  - Eventual licensing of developed software to third parties and business sale in the future

### = Next Steps and Tasks
- Conduct research on new software (Timestone):
  - Check for API existence or methods of integration with external systems
  - Evaluate how photograph data and metadata are handled
  - Confirm possibilities of replicating essential Netlife features
- Request:
  - Screen recordings showing Netlife usage and new software (if possible)
  - References and documentation of new software for technical analysis
- Security and privacy issues:
  - Local storage of images before upload to Australian server
  - Extra care with sensitive children's data (PII)
  - Parental consent and access control via unique codes for photo downloads

### =Æ Actions, Deadlines and Responsibilities
- Eduardo Marques will:
  - Investigate Timestone functionality, integration and customization feasibility
  - Follow up after initial analysis, with no immediate urgency (business partner is on vacation)
  - Evaluate approximate costs for custom system development
- Await submission of new software references and screen recordings
- Communication established via email (eduardo.marquesmarques81@gmail.com) and provided phone

### =Ý Final Considerations
- Medium/long-term objective: own exclusive system, eliminating third-party dependency
- Focus on simplicity, security and scalability of new system
- Decision process without rush, awaiting technical analysis and cost estimate for next steps
