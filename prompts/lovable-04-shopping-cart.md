**Technology:**

- Stripe Elements for payment
- Lucide React for icons

**Colors:**
- Same palette as other pages
- Success: Green (#10b981)
- Error: Red (#ef4444)
- Warning (shipping threshold): Orange (#f59e0b)

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile (<768px): Single column, cart items stacked, summary below cart
- Desktop (>768px): Cart items on left (65%), summary sidebar on right (35%)

**Animations:**
- Remove item: Slide-out and fade
- Price updates: Flash/highlight on change
- Checkout modal: Slide-up from bottom (mobile), fade-in center (desktop)

### Functional Requirements

**Cart Management:**
- Load cart from localStorage: `cart: Array<{photoId: string, product: string, finish?: string, quantity: number}>`
- Update cart when product selection changes
- Recalculate totals on any change
- Remove item with confirmation: "Remove this photo from cart?"

**Price Calculation:**
```typescript
const prices = {
  digital: 4.99,
  '4x6': 6.99,
  '5x7': 9.99,
  '8x10': 14.99,
  '11x14': 24.99,
  '16x20': 39.99,
};

const finishPricing = {
  glossy: 0,
  matte: 0,
  metallic: 5.00, // +$5 for metallic
};

const calculateShipping = (items) => {
  const hasPrints = items.some(i => i.product !== 'digital');
  if (!hasPrints) return 0;
  const subtotal = calculateSubtotal(items);
  if (subtotal >= 50) return 0; // Free shipping over $50
  return 9.99; // Flat rate
};

const calculateTax = (subtotal, shipping) => {
  const taxRate = 0.10; // 10% GST (Australian)
  return (subtotal + shipping) * taxRate;
};
```

**Checkout Flow:**
1. User clicks "Proceed to Checkout"
2. Open checkout modal (fullscreen on mobile)
3. Collect email (always required)
4. If prints in cart, collect shipping address
5. Show Stripe payment element
6. On "Place Order":
   - Validate form
   - Submit payment to Stripe
   - Create order in backend: `POST /api/orders`
   - Wait for confirmation
   - Show success or error state

**API Integration (Mock for Now):**
```typescript
interface OrderRequest {
  email: string;
  name?: string;
  phone?: string;
  shippingAddress?: Address;
  items: OrderItem[];
  paymentIntentId: string; // from Stripe
}

interface OrderResponse {
  orderId: string;
  orderNumber: string;
  totalAmount: number;
  downloadLinks?: string[]; // for digital downloads
  estimatedDelivery?: string; // for prints
  trackingUrl?: string;
}
```

**Form Validation:**
- Email: valid email format
- Name: required if prints in cart
- Address: all fields required if prints in cart
- Postcode: Australian format (4 digits)
- Payment: Stripe validates card info

**Promotional Logic:**
- Detect if user has 5+ digital downloads in cart
- Apply 20% discount automatically
- Show savings: "You saved $X.XX!"
- Free shipping if subtotal â‰¥ $50 (prints only)

### Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation through cart items
- Focus management in checkout modal (trap focus)
- Screen reader announcements for price updates
- ARIA labels for remove buttons ("Remove photo #23 from cart")
- Error messages associated with form fields (ARIA-describedby)
- Clear button states (disabled, loading)

### Component Structure

```typescript

            onUpdate={updateItem}
            onRemove={removeItem}
          />
        ))}
      </CartItems>
