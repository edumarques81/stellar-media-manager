## Risks & Mitigation

### Top Risks

**1. AI Accuracy Below Target (99%)**
- **Mitigation:** Use ensemble models, continuous learning, manual review queue
- **Contingency:** Accept 95% in MVP, improve in Phase 3

**2. Scalability Issues During Peak Events**
- **Mitigation:** Load testing, auto-scaling, CDN implementation
- **Contingency:** Batch processing during off-peak hours

**3. Pilot Photographer Adoption**
- **Mitigation:** Hands-on onboarding, training sessions, responsive support
- **Contingency:** Extend pilot period, adjust pricing model

**4. Development Timeline Delays**
- **Mitigation:** Agile methodology, weekly standups, buffer weeks in schedule
- **Contingency:** Cut non-essential MVP features, move to Phase 2
