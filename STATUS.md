## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

### Business
- [ ] **Pricing model:** Subscription vs per-event vs transaction fee vs hybrid?
- [ ] **Pilot photographers:** Who are the 10 pilots? How to recruit?
- [ ] **Launch timeline:** When should MVP be ready? (Recommend: 4 months from now)

### Technical
- [ ] **Go framework:** Chi (minimal) vs Gin (features) vs Echo (performance)?
- [ ] **State management:** Redux Toolkit vs Zustand vs Jotai?
- [ ] **AI hosting:** Self-hosted models vs cloud API (AWS Rekognition, Google Vision)?
- [ ] **Database hosting:** Self-managed RDS vs managed service (Supabase, PlanetScale)?
- [ ] **Deployment:** ECS vs EKS vs Lambda (serverless)?

### Product
- [ ] **White-label in MVP?** Or defer to Phase 4?
- [ ] **Mobile apps in MVP?** Or responsive web only?
- [ ] **Print labs:** Which Australian labs to partner with first?
- [ ] **Consent flow:** Per-event or system-wide facial recognition consent?
