2. In Notion, type `/embed` and paste the URL
3. Notion will create an interactive GitHub preview

Also embed specific file links:
- PRD: https://github.com/edumarques81/stellar-media-manager/blob/main/project-design/PRD.md
- User Stories: https://github.com/edumarques81/stellar-media-manager/tree/main/user-stories

## Tips for Notion Organization

1. **Use Icons:** Add emojis to pages for visual organization (📄 for docs, 📁 for folders, etc.)
2. **Color-Code:** Use background colors for different epics (AI Recognition = blue, Gallery = green, etc.)
3. **Link Everything:** Cross-link related pages (user stories → PRD requirements, etc.)
4. **Use Toggles:** For long content, use toggle blocks to keep pages scannable
5. **Create Views:** Use database filters/sorts to create custom views (e.g., "My Current Sprint", "High Priority Items")
6. **Add Cover Images:** Use cover images for main pages to make them visually distinct
7. **Breadcrumbs:** Enable breadcrumbs in settings so you can always navigate back
8. **Favorites:** Star frequently-used pages in the sidebar

---

## Keeping Notion Updated

**Sync with GitHub:**
1. When project documents are updated in GitHub, re-import the markdown files to Notion
2. Or, manually update Notion pages to match GitHub changes
3. Use Notion's version history to track changes over time

**Recommended Sync Frequency:**
- Weekly during active development
- After each sprint completion
- When major documents are updated (PRD, user stories, etc.)

---

## Notion-Specific Formatting Tips

**Tables:** Markdown tables import well, but you may want to convert them to Notion databases for filtering/sorting

**Code Blocks:** Use ``` for code blocks - they'll import with syntax highlighting

**Callouts:** Convert important notes to Notion callouts:
- Use `/callout` in Notion
- Choose icon and background color

**Diagrams:** Markdown doesn't support diagrams, so:
1. Create diagrams in Figma, Excalidraw, or draw.io
2. Export as PNG
3. Upload to Notion pages

---

## Example Notion Page URLs (After Import)

After importing, your Notion workspace might look like:
- `notion.so/your-workspace/Stellar-Media-Manager-xxxxx`
- `notion.so/your-workspace/Project-Overview-xxxxx`
- `notion.so/your-workspace/User-Stories-Database-xxxxx`

Share these URLs with team members for collaboration.

---

## Notion Integrations to Consider

**GitHub Integration:**
- Install Notion's GitHub integration
- Connect to stellar-media-manager repo
- Get notifications for commits, PRs, issues

**Google Calendar:**
- Sync sprint dates and milestones to Google Calendar
- Get reminders for sprint planning, reviews, retrospectives

**Slack:**
- Send Notion page updates to Slack channels
- Use Slack reminders for sprint deadlines

---

**Ready to Import?** Start with `docs/project-overview-1page.md` for a quick overview, then import other documents as needed.
