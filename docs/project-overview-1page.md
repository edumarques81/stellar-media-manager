## What Is Stellar Media Manager?

An **AI-powered photography management and distribution platform** that automates photo recognition using facial recognition, jersey numbers, and OCR. Photographers upload event photos, customers upload a selfie to instantly find their photos, and can purchase digital downloads or prints. Eliminates hours of manual photo tagging.

**Target Market:** Australian photographers (youth sports, school events, marathons)
**Competitive Edge:** Multi-modal AI fusion, intelligent print routing, white-label customization, Australian compliance

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

**Business:**
- Pricing model? (Subscription vs per-event vs transaction fee vs hybrid)
- Who are the 10 pilot photographers? Recruitment strategy?
- MVP launch deadline? (Recommend: 4 months from start)

**Technical:**
- Go framework choice? (Chi vs Gin vs Echo)
- State management? (Redux Toolkit vs Zustand)
- AI hosting? (Self-hosted models vs cloud API)
- Deployment? (ECS vs EKS vs Lambda)

**Product:**
- White-label in MVP or defer to Phase 4?
- Mobile apps in MVP or responsive web only?
- Which Australian print labs to partner with first?

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| AI accuracy <99% | High | Ensemble models, continuous learning, manual review queue |
| Scalability issues | High | Load testing, auto-scaling, CDN |
| Pilot adoption | High | Hands-on onboarding, responsive support |
| Timeline delays | Medium | Agile methodology, buffer weeks, cut non-essential features |
| Security breach | Critical | Annual audits, encryption, OWASP compliance, pen testing |
